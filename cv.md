### Briefly About Myself:

In 2010, I graduated from Vitebsk State University with a degree in Applied Mathematics. At the same time, I took courses and then an internship at EPAM Systems as a Java developer.
After graduating from the university, by distribution, I started working at the Vitebsk Olympic Reserve School. There I worked as a system administrator, created programs for accounting, drew a layout and made up a website.

A year and a half later, I changed my place of residence and redistributed to the Minsk Republican Unitary Enterprise “Beltelecom”. Worked in accounting.
After that, I went on maternity leave, during which I mastered Photoshop, mastered various retouching techniques. For a while I worked as a retoucher. However, I realized that, working as a retoucher, I would not be able to reveal my full potential. That's why I decided to return to IT.

By this time, I had mastered such graphic editors as Figma and Photoshop. Therefore, at that stage, web design was closest to me. In 2020, I took courses in UI/UX design, after which I started to work as freelancer. I mainly created banners and layouts for small projects. At the same time, I mastered layout in order to enter web development. This profession provides endless opportunities for professional growth, in addition, there are a huge number of free quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me become an experienced Frontend Developer.
