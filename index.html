        <h2>Briefly About Myself:</h2>
        <p>
          In 2010, I graduated from Vitebsk State University with a degree in
          Applied Mathematics. At the same time, I took courses and then an
          internship at EPAM Systems as a Java developer. After graduating from
          the university, by distribution, I started working at the Vitebsk
          Olympic Reserve School. There I worked as a system administrator,
          created programs for accounting, drew a layout and made up a website.
        </p>
        <p>
          A year and a half later, I changed my place of residence and
          redistributed to the Minsk Republican Unitary Enterprise “Beltelecom”.
          Worked in accounting. After that, I went on maternity leave, during
          which I mastered Photoshop, mastered various retouching techniques.
          For a while I worked as a retoucher. However, I realized that, working
          as a retoucher, I would not be able to reveal my full potential.
          That's why I decided to return to IT.
        </p>
        <p>
          By this time, I had mastered such graphic editors as Figma and
          Photoshop. Therefore, at that stage, web design was closest to me. In
          2020, I took courses in UI/UX design, after which I started to work as
          freelancer. I mainly created banners and layouts for small projects.
          At the same time, I mastered layout in order to enter web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          This profession provides endless opportunities for professional
          growth, in addition, there are a huge number of free quality resources
          for self-education and a large community of developers. I believe that
          my ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me become an
          experienced Frontend Developer.
